			@description = It was discovered by the "Ridiculously Huge Telescope", the telescope that was built only for discovering C3-3, and a relatively mundane natural satellite of Pequar. The views from the surface are fantastic, with Pequar being the main object to see in the sky. It's coposed of Siliactes, Iron and a green metal, probably rusty copper, meaning that in the past, C3-3 could have been part of Pequar's core!

		@Properties
		{
			@description = Some parts could look like flat plains but instead be mountains! C3-2 is a very defomed world, with the highlands going lots of kilometers up leaving the lowlands pretty low. Its yellow color comes from particles from Pequar's rings that collide with the asteroid. With the passing of years, all of the surface has turned to this color, but if you dig a little, maybe you could find brown rocks! Who knows?

	{

	@Body[Crons]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			@description = Crons used to be a double planet, like Prima and Secunda, but then they came close to Nienna, putting Crons in a high orbbit around Cercani and the other in interplanetary space. This new body caused big orbit changes in the two moons of Nienna. Kevari got closer and Niko get its eccentric orbit. It was previously a very active body, having a big crack though its equator, but very cratered in its poles. How this newfound orbit ended up closer to being circular, Kerbalkind may never know.
