# Planet Pack patches for Principia

This set of patches is aimed at fixing planet packs that have unstable orbits with Principia, repositioning the unstable bodies to make them stable.

Currently supported:

 - New Horizons
 - Outer Planets Mod (OPM)
 - Other Worlds


** NOTE: this mod requires also [this Kopernicus configuration](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/eggrobin/31f6d0c246ecbe50423488f867fe7051/raw/55b814cd14b3c9fdd63119cee96dacb847e2e9ea/retrobop.cfg) provided by the Principia team, to fix the Jool system when running Kopernicus. The patch has now been included in this pack **

## Repositioned bodies

### New Horizons:
	
 - Aptur - in a very high orbit around Eeloo

 - Astid - in a medium orbit around Eeloo

 - Ete - in a very high orbit around Eeloo

 - Moho - in a high orbit around Eve

## Outer Planets:

 - Ovok - In a high retrograde orbit around Sarnus, where it has frequent close encounters with Tekto

## Other Worlds:

 - C2-1 - In a high retrograde orbit around Pequar, and renamed C3-3

 - C3-1 - In a high retrograde orbit around Pequar, and renamed C3-2

 - Kevari - In a medium orbit around Nienna

 - Niko - In an ever-so-slightly-less-eccentric-but-still-pretty-darn-eccentric orbit around Nienna

 - Crons - In a high prograde orbit around Cercani
